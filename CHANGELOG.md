and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Loosened `Click` dependency to include v7.0.
- Loosened `datasets` dependency.
- Tightened `petname` dependency to exclude next major release for safety.

### Fixed

- `Workspace`, `MemoryWorkspace`, and `LocalWorkspace` can now be imported directly from the `tango`
  base module.

## [v0.4.0rc1](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.4.0rc1) - 2021-11-30

### Added

- Introduced the concept of the `Workspace`, with `LocalWorkspace` and `MemoryWorkspace` as initial implementations.
- Added a stub of a webserver that will be able to visualize runs as they happen.
- Added separate classes for `LightningTrainingTypePlugin`, `LightningPrecisionPlugin`, `LightningClusterEnvironmentPlugin`, `LightningCheckpointPlugin` for compatibility with `pytorch-lightning>=1.5.0`.
- Added a visualization of workspaces that can show step graphs while they're executing.

### Removed

- Removed old `LightningPlugin` class
- Removed requirement of the `overrides` package

### Changed

- Made it possible to construct a step graph out of `Step` objects, instead of constructing it out of `StepStub` objects.
- Removed dataset fingerprinting code, since we can now use `Step` to make sure things are cached.
- Made steps deterministic by default.
- Brought back `MemoryStepCache`, so we can run steps without configuring anything.
- W&B `torch::TrainCallback` logs with `step=step+1` now so that training curves in the W&B dashboard
  match up with checkpoints saved locally and are easier to read (e.g. step 10000 instead of 9999).
- `filelock >= 3.4` required, parameter `poll_intervall`  to `tango.common.file_lock.FileLock.acquire` renamed
  to `poll_interval`.

### Fixed

- Fixed bug in `FromParams` where a parameter to a `FromParams` class may not be instantiated correctly
  if it's a class with a generic type parameter.

## [v0.3.6](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.3.6) - 2021-11-12

### Added

- Added a `.log_batch()` method on `torch::TrainCallback` which is given the average loss across
  distributed workers, but only called every `log_every` steps.

### Removed

- Removed `.pre_log_batch()` method on `torch::TrainCallback`.

### Fixed

- Fixed typo in parameter name `remove_stale_checkpoints` in `TorchTrainStep` (previously was `remove_state_checkpoints`).
- Fixed bug in `FromParams` that would cause failures when `from __future__ import annotations`
  was used with Python older than 3.10. See [PEP 563](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0563/)
  for details.

## [v0.3.5](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.3.5) - 2021-11-05

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in `FromParams` where the "type" parameter was ignored in some cases
  where the `Registrable` base class did not directly inherit from `Registrable`.

## [v0.3.4](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.3.4) - 2021-11-04

### Added

- Added `StopEarlyCallback`, a `torch::TrainCallback` for early stopping.
- Added parameter `remove_stale_checkpoints` to `TorchTrainStep`.

### Changed

- Minor changes to `torch::TrainCallback` interface.
- Weights & Biases `torch::TrainCallback` now logs best validation metric score.

## [v0.3.3](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.3.3) - 2021-11-04

### Added

- Added support for PEP 604 in `FromParams`, i.e. writing union types as "X | Y" instead of "Union[X, Y]".
- [internals] Added a spot for miscellaneous end-to-end integration tests (not to be confused with "tests of integrations") in `tests/end_to_end/`.
- [internals] Core tests now run on all officially supported Python versions.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in `FromParams` where non-`FromParams` class parameters were not instantiated
  properly (or at all).
- Fixed a bug in `FromParams` where kwargs were not passed on from a wrapper class to the wrapped class.
- Fixed small bug where some errors from git would be printed when executor metadata is created
  outside of a git repository.

## [v0.3.2](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.3.2) - 2021-11-01

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug with `FromParams` that caused `.from_params()` to fail when the params contained
  an object that was already instantiated.
- tango command no longer installs a SIGTERM handler, which fixes some bugs with integrations that use multiprocessing.

## [v0.3.1](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.3.1) - 2021-10-29

### Changed
- Updated the `LightningTrainStep` to optionally take in a `LightningDataModule` as input.

## [v0.3.0](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.3.0) - 2021-10-28

### Added

- Added `IterableDatasetDict`, a version of `DatasetDict` for streaming-like datasets.
- Added a [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai) integration with `LightningTrainStep`.

### Fixed

- Fixed bug with `FromParams` and `Lazy` where extra arguments would sometimes be passed down through
  to a `Lazy` class when they shouldn't.

## [v0.2.4](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.2.4) - 2021-10-22

### Added

- Added support for [torch 1.10.0](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/releases).

### Changed

- `--file-friendly-logging` flag is now an option to the main `tango` command, so needs
  to be passed before `run`, e.g. `tango --file-friendly-logging run ...`.

### Fixed

- Fixed bug with `Step.from_params`.
- Ensure logging is initialized is spawn processes during distributed training with `TorchTrainStep`.

## [v0.2.3](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.2.3) - 2021-10-21

### Added

- Added support for global settings file, `tango.yml`.
- Added 'include_package' (array of string) param to config spec.
- Added a custom error `StopEarly` that a `TrainCallback` can raise within the `TorchTrainStep`
  to stop training early without crashing.
- Added step config, tango command, and tango version to executor metadata.
- Executor now also saves pip dependencies and conda environment files to the run directory
  for each step.

### Fixed

- Ensured `**kwargs` arguments are logged in `FromParams`.

## [v0.2.2](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.2.2) - 2021-10-19

### Added

- Added new steps to `datasets` integration: `ConcatenateDatasets` ("datasets::concatenate") and `InterleaveDatasets` (datasets::interleave).
- Added `__contains__` and `__iter__` methods on `DatasetDict` so that it is now a `Mapping` class.
- Added `tango info` command that - among other things - displays which integrations are installed.

## [v0.2.1](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.2.1) - 2021-10-18

### Added

- Added `convert_to_tango_dataset_dict()` function in the `datasets` integration.
  It's important for step caching purposes to use this to convert a HF `DatasetDict`
  to a native Tango `DatasetDict` when that `DatasetDict` is part of the input to another
  step. Otherwise the HF `DatasetDict` will have to be pickled to determine its hash.

### Changed

- `Format.checksum()` is now an abstract method. Subclasses should only compute checksum
  on the serialized artifact and nothing else in the directory.
- [internals] Changed the relationship between `Executor`, `StepCache`, and `Step.`
  `Executor` now owns the `StepCache`, and `Step` never interacts with `StepCache` directly.

## [v0.2.0](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.2.0) - 2021-10-15

### Added

- Added a [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai) integration with a training callback ("wandb::log")
  for `TorchTrainStep` ("torch::train") that logs training and validation metrics to W&B.

### Fixed

- Fixed `Format.checksum()` when there is a symlink to a directory in the cache folder.

## [v0.1.3](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.1.3) - 2021-10-15

### Added

- Added the ability to track a metric other than "loss" for validation in `TorchTrainStep` ("torch::train").

### Fixed

- Final model returned from `TorchTrainStep` ("torch::train") will have best weights loaded.
- Checkpoints are saved from `TorchTrainStep` ("torch::train") even when there is no validation loop.
- Fixed `TorchTrainStep` ("torch::train") when `validation_split` is `None`.
- Fixed distributed training with `TorchTrainStep` ("torch::train") on GPU devices.

## [v0.1.2](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.1.2) - 2021-10-13

### Added

- Added support for YAML configuration files.

## [v0.1.1](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.1.1) - 2021-10-12

### Added

- `TorchTrainStep` now displays a progress bar while saving a checkpoint to file.
- The default executor now saves a "executor-metadata.json" file to the directory for each step.

### Changed

- Renamed `DirectoryStepCache` to `LocalStepCache` (registered as "local").
- `LocalStepCache` saves metadata to `cache-metadata.json` instead of `metadata.json`.

### Fixed

- Fixed bug with `TorchTrainStep` during distributed training.
- `FromParams` will automatically convert strings into `Path` types now when the annotation
  is `Path`.

## [v0.1.0](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.1.0) - 2021-10-11

### Added

- Added `StepGraph` and `Executor` abstractions.
- Added a basic PyTorch training step registered as `"torch::train"`, along with other registrable
  components, such as `Model`, `DataLoader`, `Sampler`, `DataCollator`, `Optimizer`, and `LRScheduler`.
- Added `DatasetRemixStep` in `tango.steps`.
- Added module `tango.common.sequences`.
- Added `DatasetDict` class in `tango.common.dataset_dict`.
- Added [ðŸ¤— Datasets](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets) integration.
- Added command-line options to set log level or disable logging completely.

### Changed

- `Step.work_dir`, `Step.unique_id`, `Step.dependencies`, and `Step.recursive_dependencies`
  are now a properties instead of methods.
- `tango run` command will acquire a lock on the directory to avoid race conditions.
- Integrations can now be installed with `pip install tango[INTEGRATION_NAME]`. For example,
  `pip install tango[torch]`.
- Added method `Registrable.search_modules()` for automatically finding and importing the modules
  where a given ``name`` might be registered.
- `FromParams.from_params()` and `Registrable.resolve_class_name` will now call `Registrable.search_modules()` to automatically import modules where the type might be defined.
  Thus for classes that are defined and registered within any `tango.*` submodules it is not necessary to explicitly import them.

### Fixed

- `Step` implementations can now take arbitrary `**kwargs` in their `run()` methods.

## [v0.0.3](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.0.3) - 2021-09-27

- Ported over core tango components from AllenNLP.

## [v0.0.1](https://github.com/allenai/tango/releases/tag/v0.0.1) - 2021-09-22

### Added

- Added initial project boilerplate.
