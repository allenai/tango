    A :class:`TrainCallback` is a :class:`~tango.common.Registrable` class

    loop. You can set the training callbacks with the ``callbacks`` parameter to :class:`TorchTrainStep`.

        All of the parameters to this base class will be automatically set within
        the training loop, so you shouldn't include them in your config for your callbacks.

        The ``step`` argument to callback methods is the total/overall number of training steps
        so far, independent of the current epoch.
