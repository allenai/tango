    This is just a subclass of the `FileLock` class from the `filelock` library, except that
    it adds an additional argument to the `__init__` method: `read_only_ok`.

    By default this flag is `False`, which an exception will be thrown when a lock
    can't be acquired due to lack of write permissions.
    But if this flag is set to `True`, a warning will be emitted instead of an error when
    the lock already exists but the lock can't be acquired because write access is blocked.
