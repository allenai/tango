# Integration tests

These are a collection of longer running end-to-end tests of various parts of the Tango library.
At the moment we are not running these in CI since they are computationally expensive and/or require special hardware,
so they need to be run manually.

The README in each test's folder should explain when and how that particular test should be ran.
